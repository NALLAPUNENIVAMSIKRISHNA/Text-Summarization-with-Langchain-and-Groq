It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005.

      "Speech:The departing speech of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, is a heartfelt and inspiring message to the people of India and those living abroad. He reflects on his five years in office, filled with wonderful associations with people from various walks of life. He highlights 10 important messages that he wants to share with the nation, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development and fulfilling the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "3. Fostering agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food\".\n",
      "4. Defeating problems and succeeding through partnerships.\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through courage and partnership.\n",
      "6. Building connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "7. Defending the nation and upholding national pride.\n",
      "8. The importance of a youth movement for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He commends her thoughtful question and assures her that it is a goal worth striving for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, calling it thoughtful. They assured the person asking the question that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a developed and prosperous India. The speaker, likely the President of India, shares their experience of visiting a village in Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council functioning with financial powers and making decisions. The speaker emphasizes the need to empower all 600,000 villages in India to deal with their own development and be well-connected with urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has set up a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex involving 65 villages. The PURA complex provides physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity. The initiative has resulted in the creation of employment opportunities, entrepreneurs, and healthcare and education facilities. The speaker sees this as a model for mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness and empowering rural areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker discusses the success of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) initiative, which has transformed a 200-acre wasteland into cultivable land in Thanjavur district. The villagers are now engaged in various activities such as farming, plantations, and power generation using bio-mass. The initiative has also enabled them to develop innovative products with the support of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). The speaker notes that similar PURA initiatives are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a total of 7,000 such initiatives required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Meeting over 6,000 farmers from across India at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle.\n",
      "2. Meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born with no hands and legs, who despite his physical limitations, exuded confidence and happiness. When asked what he needed, he replied that he wanted to sing in front of the speaker. The speaker is inspired by Krishna Murthy's positivity and gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with the speaker's message: \"Defeat the problems and succeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about two inspiring stories of overcoming challenges. The first story is about a person with physical disabilities who, with a positive attitude and perseverance, developed a talent for music and even performed in front of a large audience. The speaker is touched by this person's story and sees it as a message that everyone has the potential to blossom and give back to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage and losses, the villagers showed remarkable courage and determination, and were able to overcome their problems and rebuild their lives. The speaker is impressed by the villagers' ability to take control of their situation and not let their problems define them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes several instances of courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The speaker shares their experiences of visiting villages affected by earthquakes and tsunamis, where they witnessed the bravery and determination of the local people, including children and village members. The speaker specifically mentions a visit to Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they were touched by the courage and generosity of the tribal islanders who took in victims as their own children. The speaker also shares a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which celebrates the courage and resilience of the islanders. The speech concludes by highlighting the importance of connectivity for societal transformation, referencing a speech the speaker gave to the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at a cost of $100 million. The network aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where students from two Ethiopian universities are taking an MBA course through the network, and specialists from a hospital in India are providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing several topics, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Indian government's collaboration with African countries to bring technology and societal transformation to the continent, specifically mentioning a tele-consultation program between Indian doctors and a hospital in Ethiopia.\n",
      "* The importance of defending the nation and the pride the speaker feels in India's armed forces, mentioning personal experiences with the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n",
      "* The dedication and commitment of India's defense forces, para-military forces, and police personnel in maintaining the country's safety and security.\n",
      "* The speaker's interaction with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India into a developed nation by 2020, through the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the \"Lead India 2020\" foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the Medak district. The training has led to positive changes in the students, such as increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of responsibility towards their nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who used the training to influence her father to stop smoking. The speaker believes that empowering India's 540 million youth below the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also pursuing economic growth. The speaker notes that the country has made significant progress in the last 60 years and has a large and hardworking youth population. They express confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker calls for a countrywide effort to empower citizens and achieve the missions of a developed India by 2020, with a distinctive profile that includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "* Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "* Integrating agriculture, industry, and services sectors\n",
      "* Providing education with a value system to all meritorious candidates, regardless of societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "* Becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines a vision for a future nation that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Provides access to quality healthcare for all\n",
      "* Has a responsive, transparent, and corruption-free government\n",
      "* Eradicates poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* Is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy\n",
      "* Continues to grow sustainably\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is by Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, and is a farewell address to the citizens of India. He expresses gratitude for their love and support over the past five years and shares his mission to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Connect the hearts and minds of Indians across the country\n",
      "* Instill self-confidence in the people, particularly the phrase \"we can do it\"\n",
      "* Work towards making India a developed nation by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He concludes by wishing the citizens God's blessings and ends with the national slogan \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",
